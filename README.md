# Cell Classification Models for the Human Protein Atlas Challenge

Our project is based on the Human Protein Atlas competition hosted on Kaggle. The motivation comes from the fact that although cells can be genetically identical, they can be different in terms of their structures and functions as their proteins can be distributed differently. Locating these proteins accurately can ultimately lead to better understanding of diseases and development of treatments. More specifically, the task is to first segment each cell in a microscope image then to classify the protein highlighted within the cell segmentation. Each prediction needs to contain the proteinsâ€™ segmentation masks and probability score. The unique challenge arises as the provided labels are image-level and not applicable for all cells within an image. For example, if an image is labeled nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane, the highlighted protein in one cell in the image can be nucleoplasm while another cell from the same image can highlight a nuclear membrane. Therefore, the task is categorized as a weakly supervised learning problem for instance segmentation. Over the course of this project, we are going to come up with a model to perform this task with a reasonable accuracy.
